Hi, I'm Josh from London, I like coffee and [Weetos](https://www.weetabixfoodcompany.co.uk/our-brands/weetos).

I currently work in film and tv, looking after the footage pipeline during production. Are the rushes (footage) safe? Are editorial happy? Is the production team happy? Does the cinematographers look pass through correctly to post production? Is the answer to these is yes, then my job is done.

Outside of work though, I have a keen interest in technology and the environment, and so I wanted an outlet to write my musings - if not for anyone else, then at least  for me!
